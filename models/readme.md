**3D model of our vehicle**

For the 3D model of the robotic vehicle our team designed we provide a Tinkercad link:

We also extracted all the parts from entire model to .stl files and created a folder which contains these files that need to be 3d printed.

All the 3d design has been made using the online 3D modelling tool www.tinkercad.com.

Parts shown in black color represent the various electronic and electric devices used for the robot, so they are not need to be printed. Also the lego axles and bushes used for the wheels mounting are also shown in black color and they are not need to be printed. In green are the rubber o-rings which play the role of tires for our vehicle. These o-rings must be of 68mm outer diameter and and 4mm thickness. We chose them to be so thin so that our vehicle would have flexibility and could be easily driven with a small dc motor. 

Everything else shown in red color should be 3D printed. Parts fixation has been made using mostly m3 and some m2 bolts. The m2 bolts are used only for the parts that are mounted the upper plastic surface like the camera,the SBC and the SBM fixation, the prototype board etc. These board have small holes and m3 bolts cannot fin. Some parts do not need bolts to fit together as they designed for press fitting (for example, the wheels with the lego axles).

We include two photos showing the assembly of the front wheels. We use a lego technic yellow axle of 5L length and two grey lego technic bush bushings for each wheel. Lego bushings are used to secure the wheel on the 3d printed wheel hub.

We used the Ultimaker Cure 5.1.0 tool as a slicer. We used a Creality Ender 3 V2 3d printer to 3d print the parts. PLA plastic seems to be sturdy enough for the needs of the WRO Future Engineer contest and we have no accidents of broken parts so far.
